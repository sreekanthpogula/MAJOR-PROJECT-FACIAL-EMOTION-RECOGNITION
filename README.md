FACIAL EMOTION RECOGNITION - 2022

Facial expression for emotion detection has always been an easy task for humans, but achieving the same task with a computer algorithm is quite challenging. With the recent advancement in computer vision and machine learning, it is possible to detect emotions from images. In this paper, we propose a novel technique called facial emotion recognition using convolutional neural networks (FERC). The FERC is based on two-part convolutional neural network (CNN): The first-part removes the background from the picture, and the second part concentrates on the facial feature vector extraction. In FERC model, expressional vector (EV) is used to find the five different types of regular facial expression.We expect the FERC emotion detection to be useful in many applications such as predictive learning of students, lie detectors, etc.
